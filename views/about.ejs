            <hr />
            <p>
                Every asset listed on TokenBar undergoes strict valuation and verification checks before being listed. Furthermore each asset Owner
                has to produce frequent verification and valudation reports regarding their asset in order for their asset to remain listed.

                <p>
                   In order to list a new asset on Tokenbar you will need to submit a proposal where you detail as much information about the asset.
                   Following this our team will review and get back to you to initiate the tokenization process. This process will involved a 
                   verification and valudation of your asset. Once this is done your asset will be tokenized on the blockchain and made available for 
                   users to buy.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The emergence of the blockchain technology has given rise to many use cases which have gret potential to revolutionise many
                        industries. One of the most lucrative and appealing uses cases is the ability of to tokenize real world assets and make them
                        available to people to extract more economic value than before. The goal of this project is to this through the cration of an
                        virtual e-commerce site that mimics the future potential that this technology will will offer once it has reached maturity. The 
                        goal of this project is to expose more poeple to the potential of blockchain by giving them a real use case platform which allow them 
                        to buy and trade tokenized assets.

                               a great learning opportunity for project members to get development exposure on each platform.
