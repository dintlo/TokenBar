                        The emergence of the blockchain technology has given rise to many use cases which have gret potential to revolutionise many
                        industries. One of the most lucrative and appealing uses cases is the ability of to tokenize real
                        world assets and make them available to people to extract more economic value than before. The goal
                        of this project is to this through the cration of an virtual e-commerce site that mimics the future
                        potential that this technology will will offer once it has reached maturity. The goal of this project
                        is to expose more poeple to the potential of blockchain by giving them a real use case platform which
                        allow them to buy and trade tokenized assets.

                        Due to the fast changing blockchain protocol landscape, the goal of the project to be as open as possible and not be fixated
                        on a specific blockchain. Thus the aim is to build upon all major blockchains. This also provides
                        a great learning opportunity for project members to get development exposure on each platform. So
                        far the current consensus in the team is to focus on the following major platforms:
